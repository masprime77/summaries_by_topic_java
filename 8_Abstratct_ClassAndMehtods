Abstract Classes:
    - They're classes from which you cannot create objects. I cannot create an Animal, but a Cat is posible.
    - For example you cannot create an Animal (parent class), but you can create a Cat (child class).

        public abstract class Animal {
            int age;
            String name;
        }

        public class Cat extends Animal {

        }

Abstract Methods:
    - Similar to abstract classes, they're methods that cannot be used or implemented in the class from they are from.
    - For example an abstract method in Animal must be implemented in Cat.
    - It forces the children classes to implement the method.

        public abstract class Animal {
            int age;
            String name;

            public abstract void makeNoise();
        }

        public class Cat extends Animal {

            @Override
            public void makeNoise() {
                System.out.print("Meow");
            }
        }

The difference between abstract class and interface is that you can only extend one other class,
    but unlimited interfaces.
