Static classes:
    In a Nutshell:
        - Static means Class-method.
        - Non-static means: Object-method

    - I cannot reference a non-static (variable) in a static (method).
    - You can use a class-method through an object (Discouraged!!).

Static variables:
    - Accesible via the class.
    - Usually for constants.

- non-static: different for each object
- static: general for all the objects of a class
