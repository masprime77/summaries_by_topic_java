- Its only usable by functional interfaces. In other words, interfaces with only one method.
- Allows an implementation of a method from an interface to be saved like an object.
- Is like an Anonymous class, only that resumed. It's used normally when the implementation uses simple logic.

Example:
    public interface Interface {
        void method();
    }

    public class Main {

        public static void main(String[] args) {

            Object object = new Object();
            Interface lambdaExample = () -> System.out.println("Hello")
            doThing(lambdaExample);

        }

        public void doThing(Interface interface) {
            interface.method();
        }


    }
