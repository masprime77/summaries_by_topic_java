Example:
    - public record RecordExample (String name, int age){}

- It's like a class that only holds data.
- A Record is a class with prefabricated methods and constructors.
- A Record is inmutable (similar to final).
- Records cannot extend other class (cause it already extends the Record class).
- Other than that a Record operates just like a normal class.

- Prefabricated:
    + A constructor that saves all the args of the record.
    + A 'get' method for all the args
    + A 'toString' method
    + An 'equals' implementation
