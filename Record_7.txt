Example:
    - public record RecordExample (String name, int age){}

- it's like a class that only holds data
- a Record is a class with prefabricated methods and constructors
- a Record is inmutable (similar to final)
- Records cannot extend other class (cause it already extends the Record class)
- other than that a Record operates just like a normal class

- Prefabricated:
    + a constructor that saves all the args of the record
    + a 'get' method for all the args
    + a 'toString' method
    + an 'equals' implementation
