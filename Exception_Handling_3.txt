try {
    // Code that may cause an exception
} catch (TypeOfException toe) {
    // Code that we want to execute if we catch this exception
} catch (TypeOfException toe) {
    // Code that we want to execute if we catch this exception
} finally {
    * finally is not necessary
    // Whether there was an Exception or not, this code will be executed
    // NO MATTER WHAT, even if there's a return statement
    // Finally override other returns
    // Not very used
}

Usually:
    catch (Exception e)
