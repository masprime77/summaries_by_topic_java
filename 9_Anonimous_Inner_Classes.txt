- It's like creating a subclass with its own implementation. Only that you're going to use it one time.

Example:

    public class Example {

        public static void main (String[] args) {

            Animal animal = new Animal();
            animal.makeNoise();

            Animal bigfoot = new Animal() {
                public void makeNoise() {
                    System.out.println("roar");
                }
            };

        }

    }

Example 2 (creating a method of an Interface):

    Runnable runnable = new Runnable() {
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Hello");
        }
    };

    - In this case, we are like crating a class that implements the Runnable interface.
